Automating a Mars Rover extends its powers more than human control. This project uses concepts of path planning and CV, which have many real-life applications like face vision, automatic vehicles, surveillance, detection, etc., which interests me. Stimulating a rover, its localization and finding pathways connect so much to reality. It will be fun to try out every block you write.
